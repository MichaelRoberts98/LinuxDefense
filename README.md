# RedWatch
Repository for creating an Enterprise Linux protection tool. Throughout the development teams work at various companies, we have noticed a need for a quality, open-source, Linux endpoint protection tool. The commercial offerings for Linux endpoint protection tools are closed source, features are not well documented, and are usually not compatible across multiple distributions.
